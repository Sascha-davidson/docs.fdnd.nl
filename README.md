# docs.fdnd.nl

It's two things: 1) a markdown parser for our doc files and 2) our doc files in both markdown and HTML format.

## Why

Because we want all our infos to be publicly accesible and adressable. If you disagree or want to react to any part of this project please drop us an issue.

## Install

Fork this repository

Run `npm install`

Run `npm start` to build the documents in the docs folder and parse them to the build folder.
